# ✅ Phase 2 Complete - Frontend Connected to Backend!

## 🎉 What's Been Implemented

Phase 2 is **100% complete**. The frontend is now fully connected to the backend APIs with React Query and polling.

### Files Modified/Created:

1. **src/main.tsx** ✅
   - Added QueryClientProvider wrapping the entire app
   - Configured React Query with sensible defaults

2. **src/App.tsx** ✅
   - Removed duplicate QueryClientProvider (now in main.tsx)
   - Kept Toaster components for notifications

3. **src/pages/Dashboard.tsx** ✅ FULLY REWRITTEN
   - Connected to `/api/simulations/list` with React Query
   - Create simulation form calls `/api/simulations/create`
   - Shows loading states during creation
   - Displays real simulation history from database
   - Formats dates (e.g., "2 hours ago")
   - Shows status indicators (Generating..., Failed)
   - Navigates to simulation page on creation
   - Toast notifications for success/errors

4. **src/pages/Simulation.tsx** ✅ FULLY REWRITTEN
   - Fetches simulation from `/api/simulations/:id`
   - **Polling every 2 seconds** while status = "generating"
   - Stops polling when status = "completed"
   - Displays real AI-generated tweets
   - Maps sentiment (praise→positive, worry→negative)
   - Fun random loading messages
   - Edit & Rerun functionality (calls `/api/simulations/rerun`)
   - Download summary as text file
   - Proper error handling

5. **api/simulations/list.ts** ✅ NEW
   - Fetches all user's simulations
   - Clerk JWT verification
   - Orders by created_at DESC
   - Returns formatted simulation array

6. **src/lib/api.ts** ✅ UPDATED
   - Added Clerk token getter setup
   - Ready for API calls with authentication

## 🧪 How to Test (5 Minutes)

### Critical: First Run Supabase Schema!

**Before testing, you MUST do this ONE time:**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/txyerrwezxrtpqnllpxa/sql
2. Click "New Query"
3. Copy ALL contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
4. Paste and click "Run"
5. Verify in Table Editor: 3 tables (users, simulations, generated_tweets)

**Without this, everything will fail!**

### Test the Full Flow:

```bash
# Make sure dev server is running (should already be running)
npm run dev
```

**Step-by-step test:**

1. ✅ **Sign Up**
   - Go to http://localhost:8080
   - Click "Get Started"
   - Sign up with test email
   - Should redirect to `/dashboard`

2. ✅ **Create Simulation**
   - Click "Create New Simulation"
   - Idea: "A dating app for finding hiking buddies"
   - Audience: "Tech Twitter"
   - Tweet count: 20
   - Click "Simulate"
   - Should see toast: "Simulation created!"
   - Should navigate to `/simulation/:id`

3. ✅ **Watch Generation**
   - Should see fun loading message
   - Check browser DevTools → Network tab
   - Should see polling requests every 2 seconds to `/api/simulations/:id`
   - Wait 10-15 seconds

4. ✅ **View Tweets**
   - Tweets should appear!
   - Should see ~20 different tweets
   - Mix of positive (green), negative (red), neutral (blue)
   - Different usernames
   - Varied content

5. ✅ **Check Database**
   - Go to Supabase Table Editor
   - Check `simulations` → Should see 1 row (status: "completed")
   - Check `generated_tweets` → Should see ~20 rows
   - Check `users` → Should see your user

6. ✅ **Test History**
   - Go back to Dashboard (click "Back")
   - Should see your simulation in "Previous Simulations"
   - Shows: idea text, tweet count, audience, time ago
   - Click it → Should go to results page

7. ✅ **Test Edit & Rerun**
   - Click "Edit" button
   - Change idea to: "A dating app for finding hiking buddies in the metaverse"
   - Click "Rerun Simulation"
   - Should start generating again
   - New tweets should appear after ~15 seconds

8. ✅ **Test Download**
   - Click "Download Summary"
   - Should download a .txt file
   - Open it → Should contain top praises and concerns

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Phase 2 is successful when:

- ✅ User can sign up and see dashboard
- ✅ User can create simulation from form
- ✅ Simulation appears in "Previous Simulations" list
- ✅ Navigates to simulation page after creation
- ✅ Shows "Generating..." with polling
- ✅ Tweets appear after 10-15 seconds
- ✅ Can see tweets with proper sentiment colors
- ✅ Can edit and rerun simulation
- ✅ Can download summary
- ✅ Everything saves to Supabase database
- ✅ No errors in browser console
- ✅ No errors in terminal logs

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to fetch simulations"
**Cause:** Supabase schema not set up
**Fix:** Run `supabase-schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

### Issue: "Invalid or expired token"
**Cause:** Clerk authentication issue
**Fix:** 
- Sign out and sign back in
- Check `.env.local` has `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- Restart dev server

### Issue: Polling never stops / stuck on "Generating..."
**Cause:** Backend generation failed
**Fix:**
- Check terminal logs for errors
- Check Supabase `simulations` table → status should be "completed"
- If stuck on "generating", manually update: `UPDATE simulations SET status='failed' WHERE id='...'`

### Issue: No tweets appear even after 30+ seconds
**Cause:** OpenAI API issue
**Fix:**
- Check terminal logs for OpenAI errors
- Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
- Check OpenAI dashboard for API limits/credits

### Issue: "User not found"
**Cause:** User not created in Supabase
**Fix:**
- Check `users` table in Supabase
- Try signing up with a different email
- Check terminal logs for user creation errors
